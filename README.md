In the digital age, technological advancements have revolutionized various aspects of 
healthcare, including blood management. The Blood Management System, also known 
as the Electronic Blood Management System or Blood Bank Information System, is a 
comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and automate the processes 
associated with blood banking and transfusion services.
The Blood Management System integrates various modules and functionalities to 
digitize and centralize the entire workflow, from blood donation and inventory 
management to patient transfusion records and regulatory compliance. This electronic 
system eliminates the need for manual record-keeping and paperwork, significantly 
improving efficiency, accuracy, and patient safety in blood transfusion processes.
